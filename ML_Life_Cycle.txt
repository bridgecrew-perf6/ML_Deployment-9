                            Monitor and maintain system                 . Calculate the metrics
                                                                        . Find Concept and Data Drift
                                                                          and find ways to fix it


Main Scope of the Learning:

1.  Deployment
2.  Modelling
3.  Data
4.  Scoping


1. Deployment:

        The main challenges of Deployment is Concept Drift and Data Drift

        Its means what if the data changes if the model has already been deployed.

        If you trained you model with old data but there are more patterns in the new data
        which the model could not capture earlier.

        When the data changes 
                    It can be gradual change but changes very slowly.
             or     It can be rapid which can be sudden shock to the model or system


        Data Drift                  happens when data changes
        Concept Drift/Model drift   happens when parameters change


        Other challenges are software engineering issues:

            Check list of questions:

                . Realtime or Batch
                . Cloud Vs Edge/Browser
                . compute resources (cpu/gpu/memory)
                . Latency, Throughput (How many queries per second (QPS))
                . Logging
                . Security and Privacy
        

    Common Deployment Cases:

        1.  New Product/Capability
        2.  Automate/assist with manual task
        3.  Replace previous ML system

        Key Ideas:
            
            .   Gradual ramp up with Monitoring
            .   RollBack
        
    Deployment Types:

        1.  Shadow mode Deployment
        2.  Canary Deployment

        3.  Blue green Deployment 
            In this, the prediction is made by both older and newer versions of the model
            But, prediction service is rapidly moved to new or green version.
            
            It is an easy way to RollBack

    Degree of automation:

        Human only ---> Shadow Mode ---> AI assistance ---> Partial automation --> Full automation

        AI assistance and Partial automation are the human in the loop automation.



    Monitoring The models:


        . Brainstorm the things that can go wrong
        . Brainstorm the metrics/statistics that can detect the problem

        some examples of metrics to track:
            
            software metrics:
                Memory, Compute, Latency, Throughput, Server Load
            
            Input metrics:

                Average Input Length
                Average Input Volume
                Number of missing values
                Average image brightness
            
            Output metrics:
                    the following are in the case speech recognition model

                # of times returns " "(Null)  when searched
                # times user redoes search
                # times user switches to typing (because he frustrated with voice search)

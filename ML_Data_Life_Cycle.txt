Data in production Machine learning Environment:


    Collecting, Labeling, and Validating the Data:


    Traditional ML modelling requires:

        Data --> training --> Evaluation

    Production ML systems require much more:

        Configuration
            Data Collection
                Data Verification
                    feature Extraction
                        ML Code
                            Machine resource Mgmt
                                Analysis Tools
                                    Process management Tools
                                        Serving infrastructure
                                            Monitoring
    

    ML modelling Vs Production ML:

                           Academic/Research ML         |   Production ML
    Data                   Static                       |   Dynamic-shifting
    Priority for Design    Highest overall accuracy     |   Fast inference, good interpretability              
    Model training         Optimal tuning and Training  |   Continuously assess and retrain
    Fairness               Very Important               |   Crucial



    Modern software development accounts for 

    >   Scalability
    >   Extensibility
    >   Configuration
    >   Consistancy & Reproducability
    >   Safety & Security
    >   Modularity
    >   Testability
    >   Monitoring
    >   Best Practices

                |        |----------|                  |  New Data
                |                                      |
                |--------------------------------------|


        Challenges in production ML:

            1.  Build integrated systems
            2.  Continuously operate it in production
            3.  Optimize compute resource Cost 

Collecting Data:

    Main points are:
        Importance of Data Quality
        Data Pipeline:  Data Collection, Ingestion, and Preparation
        Data Collection and Monitoring 
    

        f(Garbage Data) = Garbage Data
            if input is garbage then output is also garbage
        
        Data Pipeline:

            Data Collection
            Data Ingestion
            Data Formatting
            Feature Engineering
            Feature Extraction
        

        Get to know about the data:

            Indentify Data Sources
            Check if they are refreshed
            Consistancy for Values,units and Data Types
            Monitor Outliers and Errors
